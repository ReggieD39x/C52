        <p style="color:green"> <b>Wassup Y'all! My name is <span style="color:red">Reginald A. Daniels III</span> and I
                was born in Cook
                County on the south side of Chicago on June 2nd 1994. My parents were married and divorced by the
                time I was about 4 or 5 years old. I ended up staying my Dad, but my Mom was still around even
                though she did her fair share of traveling. I had a solid, working class upbringing in my
                Grandparents home with my Father, Sister and little brother. I graduated from Dunbar Vocational
                Highschool in 2013 and I've been floating through this fine country ever since. I'm an artist and
                I'm passionate about music and writing. I love interacting with and speaking to interesting people
                of all backgrounds and asking a lot of questions. I'm a huge nerd! I adore literature and will read
                anything that interests me but I have a special place in my heart for science fiction. Family is
                aslo very important to me and I enjoy spending time with my Grandparents, parents and siblings

        <p style="color:green"> <b>I've been listening to E.T. the Hip-Hop preacher since my college days. This video in
                particular had a profound effect on me when I discovered it around about 2015 or so. The pure fire and
                truth expressed within makes me want to climb mountains and slay dragons and be the greatest man I can
                possibly be. Its a swift kick in the pants that reminds me to keep my room clean before I comment on the
                condition of some eleses. E.T. himself is an inspirational figure considering he was once homeless and
                has in addition been beset by all manor of misfortune through out his very interesting life. However,
                his seemingly unbreakable will along with his faith in God keeps him going, just as it does myself.
                Thats why I find this video supremely motivational.<b /></p>
